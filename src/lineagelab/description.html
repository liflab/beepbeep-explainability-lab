<p><a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep</a> is an open
source event stream processing engine. It has recently been extended with
<strong>data lineage</strong> functionalities, which allow an output result
to be "explained" by retracing the inputs that have contributed to the
production of a given output.</p>

<p>This benchmark contains a set of experiments aimed at assessing the
overhead incurred by the use of these lineage functionalities, compared with
the original mode of processing. It focuses on the slowdown caused by
the handling of lineage information, as well as on the added memory
consumption. In order to do so, the benchmark defines a number of BeepBeep
processor chains (called "stream queries"), evaluates them on randomly
generated input streams (both with and without lineage tracking), and
compares their throughput and memory consumption.</p>

<p>The results in this benchmark are discussed in the following publication:</p>
